# Landing Page Udacity Project by Bren Warren

## Description

I developed this page to put recently learned knowledge of manipulating the DOM into practice, with the focus on creating a dynamic navigation menue and dynamic highlighting of page sections. 

## Usage

This format of web page could be used for almost any simple information page. The landing page design provides a slicker, visually pleasing and clearer presentation than a more static, basic page might. 

## Dependencies

This landing page focuses on Java Script, but is also depedent on CSS and HTML. 

### Java Script

The techniques used for the JS include: event listeners, adding classes actively, create element methods, get attribute methods, append methods, remove methods, loops.

# UPDATE

I've added a `.container` class to the main element of the html and added responsive CSS code to the **style.css** file.
